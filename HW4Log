Input a string: hey what does this do?
Here is your string: hey what does this do?
Now input another one: is this a good idea
Here is your second string: is this a good idea
Now we will temporarily add them together (demonstrating the + operator): hey what does this do?is this a good idea
Now I'm going to permanently modify the second string by concatenating (+=) the first one to the end of it...
Here is string 't': is this a good ideahey what does this do? ... and here is the unchanged string 's': hey what does this do?
Now I've made a copy of that string (demonstrating the String copy constructor)... Here it is: is this a good ideahey what does this do?
We will now refer to this copied string as 'u'

I will now modify and compare (using the boolean operators) these two strings.
Here is 't' now: cat
And here is 'u' now: catz
Example of == Operator - 't' should not be equal to 'u' : 0
Now 't' is also equal to 'catz' (using the = assignment operator).
Example of == Operator - 't' and 'u' should be equal now: 1

Now we will make 't' become 'warmachine' and 'u' become 'mach'.
What is the index of the letter r in 't' (warmachine)? It should be 2... : 2
Here is an example of the [] operator - the char at index 2 in 't' should be the letter r: r
What is the index of the letter h in 'u' (mach)?  It should be 3... : 3
What is the index of the letter z in 't' (warmachine)?  It should return -1 because there is none: -1
What is the index of null character in 'u' (mach)?  It should return -1 because there is none: -1
How many letters are there in 'warmachine' (t) ? It should be 10! : 10

Last but not least, let's intialize an empty string.
Here is x, the empty string: 
x has a length of : 0
If we try to find the index of the letter 'a' in the string 'x' it should return -1 because it is an empty string!: -1
If we add the 'hippo' to x, it becomes... : hippo and it has a length of 5
Here is x.indexOf(128) - it should return -1 since there is no Ã‡ in it: -1
That's it!
